IMPORTANT: Do NOT change any existing features that are working. Only ADD the missing metrics.

=== PART 1: ADD MISSING METRICS ===

1. LEVERAGE SECTION in Deal Summary tab (add new section):
   - Total Outstanding Debt: sum of all Est. Remaining
   - Leverage Ratio: (Total Outstanding / Avg Monthly Revenue) × 100
   - DTI: (Monthly Holdback / Monthly Revenue) × 100
   - Debt Service Coverage Ratio: Monthly Revenue / Monthly Holdback

2. FIX ADB/Payment Ratio:
   - Currently shows 0.00x
   - Should be: Avg Daily Balance / Daily Payment
   - Check why ADB is not being passed to the calculation

3. ADD Per-Position Holdback % column:
   - In positions table, add column: (Position Monthly Cost / Monthly Revenue) × 100

4. ADD Expense Summary section in Deal Summary:
   - Pull from existing recurring_expenses data
   - Show: Payroll, Rent, Utilities, Supplies, Total

5. ADD Net Available Cash Flow:
   - = Monthly Revenue - Monthly Holdback - Total Operating Expenses

=== PART 2: MONTHLY BREAKDOWN BY ACCOUNT ===

The Monthly Analysis should show:

TRUIST ACCOUNT:
| Month | Deposits | Withdrawals | Net | Ending Balance |
| Nov 2025 | $183,453 | $192,181 | -$8,727 | $12,778 |
| Dec 2025 | $190,293 | $202,024 | -$11,730 | $1,047 |
| Jan 2026 | $31,309 | $31,990 | -$680 | $366 |
| TRUIST TOTAL | $405,055 | $426,195 | -$21,137 | |

PNC ACCOUNT:
| Month | Deposits | Withdrawals | Net | Ending Balance |
| Dec 2025 | $48,244 | $47,981 | $263 | $263 |
| Jan 2026 | $141,309 | $131,495 | $9,814 | $10,077 |
| PNC TOTAL | $189,553 | $179,476 | $10,077 | |

COMBINED TOTAL:
| Total Deposits | Total Withdrawals | Net Cash Flow |
| $594,608 | $605,671 | -$11,060 |

=== PART 3: REVERSE ENGINEERING - HANDLE UNKNOWNS ===

For reverse-engineered position data:
- Est. Funding Amount: If we can't calculate it, show "Unknown" not a guessed number
- Est. Remaining: If we don't know original funding, show "Unknown"
- Paid In %: If we don't know total payback, show "Unknown"
- Est. Payoff: If we can't calculate, show "Unknown"

ONLY show calculated values when we KNOW:
- The original funding amount (from detected wire/deposit), OR
- Enough payment history to reverse-engineer it confidently

If we only see payments but don't know the original deal terms, show:
- Payment Amount: $297.91 ✓ (we know this)
- Frequency: Daily ✓ (we can detect this)
- Monthly Cost: $6,405 ✓ (we can calculate this)
- Est. Funding: "Unknown" (we're guessing)
- Est. Remaining: "Unknown" (we're guessing)
- Paid In %: "Unknown" (we're guessing)

=== PART 4: VERIFY SCRUBBER EXCLUSIONS ===

Confirm these features are working (don't rebuild, just verify):

1. INTERNAL TRANSFERS (Apex Test):
   - Transfers between Truist ↔ PNC accounts
   - Should be EXCLUDED from revenue (count deposit side only once)

2. OWNER DEPOSITS:
   - Deposits from owner's personal account
   - Should be EXCLUDED from revenue

3. LOAN PROCEEDS:
   - Large deposits from MCA funders (the funding, not revenue)
   - Should be EXCLUDED from revenue

Show me what's being excluded from revenue and why.
