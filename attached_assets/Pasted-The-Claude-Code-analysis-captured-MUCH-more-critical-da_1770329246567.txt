The Claude Code analysis captured MUCH more critical data that our system is missing. Here's what we need to match:

## MISSING DATA - MUST ADD:

### 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY (Claude has, we don't)
- Business Name: AD BAGELS LLC / PALM BEACH BAGELS

- Net Cash Flow: -$11,061.59
- Avg Monthly Deposits: $198,203
- Current Balance: $10,444.10
- Estimated Monthly Revenue: $129,000 - $135,000

### 2. FUNDING ANALYSIS (Claude has, we don't)
Identified funding events (wire transfers):
- 11/25/2025: $5,000 wire (Truist)
- 11/28/2025: $15,767.12 DoorDash Capital (CONFIRMED)
- 12/09/2025: $7,500 wire
- 12/24/2025: $18,000 wire - LIKELY NEW MCA
- 12/31/2025: $4,500 wire
- 01/09/2026: $16,000 wire (PNC) - NEW MCA
- 01/23/2026: $18,000 wire (PNC) - MOST RECENT FUNDING

### 3. REVERSE ENGINEERED MCA POSITIONS (Claude found 9, we found 0)
| Funder | ACH ID | Frequency | Payment | Monthly Cost | Est. Funding | Est. Remaining |
|--------|--------|-----------|---------|--------------|--------------|----------------|
| eFinancialTree | 9144978400 | Daily | $297.91 | $6,554 | $28,000 | $20,000 |
| CAPYBARA | 5612081085 | Daily | $288 | $6,336 | $27,000 | $20,000 |
| Ivy Receivables/Fox | 7183166893 | Weekly | $400 | $1,600 | $7,000 | $4,000 |
| Rauch-Milliken | D002xxxxx | Weekly | $750 | $3,000 | $13,000 | $8,000 |
| DoorDash Capital | DoorDash | Weekly | $400 | $1,600 | $15,767 | $10,000 |
| SL Recovery | SLRECOVERY | Bi-weekly | $1,300 | $2,600 | $20,000 | $12,000 |
| SpotOn (minpmt) | minpmt | Monthly | $6,734.75 | $6,734 | $55,000 | $40,000 |

TOTAL MONTHLY DEBT: ~$28,000
TOTAL OUTSTANDING: $166,000 - $200,000

### 4. PAYMENT TRACKING (Claude has, we don't)
Shows payment CHANGES over time:
- CAPYBARA: STOPPED after 12/12 (paid off or default?)
- SL Recovery: -43% reduced ($2,275 → $1,300)
- SpotOn: -94% reduced ($6,734 → $400)

### 5. KEY RED FLAGS (Claude identified, we didn't)
1. MOST RECENT FUNDING: 01/23/2026 - only 13 days ago
2. NEW BANK ACCOUNT: PNC opened 12/19/2025 (diversion?)
3. STACKING CONFIRMED: 7+ active MCA positions
4. DAILY DEBT SERVICE: $586/day just for top 2 funders
5. RETURNED DEPOSITS: $47,950 in Dec 2025 (possible kiting)
6. PATTERN: Taking new positions to pay existing (debt spiral)

### 6. REVENUE SOURCES (Claude has, we don't)
- Shift4 (CC Processing): $90,000/month
- SpotOn: $15,000/month
- DoorDash: $8,000/month
- GrubHub: $4,000/month
- Uber Eats: $6,000/month
- Counter Deposits (Cash): $4,000/month

### 7. RECURRING EXPENSES (Claude has, we don't)
- ADP Payroll: ~$2,945/week
- Cheney Brothers (Food): $1,200 2-3x/week
- All Florida Paper: $800/week
- FPL Electric: $2,300/month
- Comcast: $790/month

## THE PROBLEM:
Our system sees the transactions but isn't:
1. Detecting MCA lenders from ACH identifiers (9144978400 = eFinancialTree)
2. Grouping recurring payments to identify positions
3. Calculating reverse-engineered funding amounts
4. Tracking payment changes over time
5. Identifying funding events (large wires/deposits)
6. Categorizing revenue sources vs expenses
7. Flagging red flags (stacking, diversion, returned items)

Please implement these features to match the Claude analysis quality.
