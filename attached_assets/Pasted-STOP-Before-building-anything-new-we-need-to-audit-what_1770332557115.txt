STOP. Before building anything new, we need to audit what's already supposed to be there.

I provided complete code in Phase 2, 3, 3.5, and 5 prompts. That code included:

## CHECK IF THESE EXIST AND ARE FULLY IMPLEMENTED (not stubs):

### 1. OCR ENGINE (ocr_engine.py)
- [ ] pdfplumber extraction as primary method
- [ ] pytesseract OCR as FALLBACK when pdfplumber fails
- [ ] PDF metadata fraud check (detects Photoshop/Canva/GIMP in creator field)
- [ ] Generic parser that works on ANY bank (not bank-specific parsers)
- [ ] Auto-detects date formats (MM/DD/YYYY, MM/DD/YY, etc.)
- [ ] Auto-detects debit vs credit from columns or keywords
- [ ] Address extraction from first page
- [ ] Bank name identification from patterns

### 2. SCRUBBER (scrubber.py)
- [ ] Separates gross deposits from net revenue
- [ ] Excludes: internal transfers, loan proceeds, owner deposits, refunds
- [ ] Apex Test: detects transfers between multiple accounts
- [ ] Concentration risk analysis (% from top depositors)

### 3. RISK ENGINE (risk_engine.py)
- [ ] NSF/overdraft counting and fee totals
- [ ] Negative balance day tracking
- [ ] Gambling transaction detection
- [ ] Red flag detection (garnishments, tax liens, judgments)
- [ ] Expense categorization (payroll, rent, utilities, etc.)
- [ ] Revenue velocity/acceleration (is revenue declining faster?)
- [ ] Risk score calculation (0-100 with specific deductions)
- [ ] Risk tier assignment (A/B/C/D)

### 4. POSITION DETECTOR (position_detector.py)
- [ ] Detects MCA lenders from 60+ keywords across 4 tiers
- [ ] Groups recurring payments by lender
- [ ] Frequency detection: daily (15+/mo), weekly (4-5/mo), biweekly (2/mo), monthly (1/mo)
- [ ] Reverse engineering: estimates original funding, factor rate, remaining balance, payoff date
- [ ] Tracks payment changes over time
- [ ] Identifies funding events (large wires/deposits)

### 5. LENDER MATCHER (lender_matcher.py)
- [ ] Loads lender criteria from CSV (73 columns)
- [ ] Hard disqualifications (instant NO)
- [ ] Soft preferences (affects score)
- [ ] Match scoring (0-100)
- [ ] Returns eligible lenders with contact info
- [ ] Returns disqualified lenders with specific reasons

### 6. CALCULATOR (calculator.py)
- [ ] DTI calculation
- [ ] Holdback percentage
- [ ] Net available revenue
- [ ] Max recommended funding
- [ ] Max daily payment (10% of lowest month)
- [ ] Cash flow coverage ratio
- [ ] Advance caps by tier

### 7. REPORTER (reporter.py)
- [ ] 5-tab Excel generation
- [ ] Deal Summary tab (SPEC SHEET style)
- [ ] Monthly holdback breakdown by month
- [ ] Position details with paid-in %, payoff dates
- [ ] Formatting: currency, percentages, red/green for pass/fail

### 8. DEAL INPUT (deal_input.py)
- [ ] Manual input form
- [ ] Position override (add/edit/delete)
- [ ] Merge OCR data with manual overrides

### 9. CONFIG FILES
- [ ] keywords.json: 60+ MCA lenders, NSF keywords, gambling keywords, red flags
- [ ] funder_rates_complete.json: 100+ funders with factor rates
- [ ] lender_aliases.json: Fuzzy matching variations

## WHAT I NEED YOU TO DO:

1. Go through each checkbox above
2. Check if the code EXISTS and is FULLY IMPLEMENTED (not pass/stub/TODO)
3. Report back: "✅ Implemented" or "❌ Missing" for each item
4. For anything missing - explain why it didn't get implemented from the prompts I provided

DO NOT build new code yet. First tell me what's there vs what's missing.
